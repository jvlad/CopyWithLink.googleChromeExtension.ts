# Copy With Link
Google Chrome Browser extension


## What does it do
Copy any text on a web-page **with web-page URL and time stamp** directly to clipboard.


## [Install for Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-with-link/gkgjcnhkahjgahklmjmnodpmifkmkcca)


## Use it
1. On any web-page just select text you want to copy and Press `Alt+C`.
1. Go to any text-editor (or other text-input area) and press `Ctrl+V` to paste copied text with its source URL.


## Example
After selecting "ClipWithURL" on this page and hitting the shortcut (default is `Alt+C`), you can paste the text to any place you want having the timestamp and source link next to it. Here is how it should look like:
```
'Quoted text'  
    Thu Jun 22 01:44:26 IDT 2017  
    https://github.com/jvlad/ClipWithUrl.googleChromeExtension.js
```

Timestamp is composed at the moment you are actually pressing `Alt+C`.  
"source" contains what you see at your browser's address bar at the moment of pressing the shortcut.


## Custom shortcut
You can always change default `Alt+C` keys shortcut. To do so

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and go to `Keyboard shortcuts` link
3. Find `Copy with Link` section and adjust `Copy to clipboard with source link` shortcut.
